## 🛠️ Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

Analyze a file with default settings:
```bash
./stegtool.sh <path_to_file>
```

Example:
```bash
./stegtool.sh suspicious_image.png
```

### Command-Line Options

```
Usage: ./stegtool.sh [OPTIONS] <file>

Options:
  -i, --interactive    Enable interactive mode
  -b, --batch          Enable batch mode (process multiple files)
  -s, --security LEVEL Set security level (minimal, normal, paranoid)
  -np, --no-progress   Disable progress indicators
  --                   End of options (useful when filenames start with -)

Examples:
  # Basic analysis (single file)
  ./stegtool.sh image.jpg
  
  # Interactive mode
  ./stegtool.sh -i secret_file.png
  
  # Batch process multiple files
  ./stegtool.sh -b file1.jpg file2.png file3.doc
  
  # Set security level
  ./stegtool.sh -s paranoid sensitive_file.jpg
  
  # Disable progress indicators (useful for logging)
  ./stegtool.sh -np document.pdf
```

### Interactive Mode

Start interactive mode for a guided analysis experience:
```bash
./stegtool.sh -i file_to_analyze
```

In interactive mode, the tool will:
1. Prompt you before running each analysis phase
2. Show real-time progress and results
3. Allow you to skip or retry analysis steps
4. Provide contextual help when needed
5. Dynamically adjust options based on file type and installed tools (**Smart Mode**)
6. Let you view results at any time without exiting

**New Enhancements:**

- **Phase-Based Execution** – Run specific phases individually:
  - Basic File Analysis
  - Metadata Analysis
  - File Carving
  - Image-Specific Analysis
  - Audio/Video Analysis
  - Advanced File Carving
- **Run All Phases with Auto-Summary** – When you choose “Run All Phases,” the tool:
  - Executes the complete `analyze_file` pipeline
  - Immediately shows the generated `analysis_summary.txt` for quick review
- **On-Demand Summary View** – Check results mid-session without restarting
- **Smart Tool Detection** – Hides irrelevant options for your file type and installed tools
- **No Restart Needed** – Skip, repeat, or run different phases in one session

**Example Menu:**
```
===== Interactive Analysis Menu =====
1) Basic File Analysis
2) Metadata Analysis
3) File Carving
4) Image-Specific Analysis
5) Audio/Video Analysis
6) Advanced File Carving
7) Run All Phases
8) View Analysis Summary
9) Exit Interactive Mode
```

When the analysis is complete, you’ll be given options to:
- View the full analysis log
- Open the output directory
- Try additional analysis steps
- Exit the program

### Batch Processing

Process multiple files:
```bash
for file in *.jpg; do
    ./stegtool.sh "$file"
done
```
